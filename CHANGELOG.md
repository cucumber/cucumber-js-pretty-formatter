* This is the first version of the pretty formatter that supports Cucumber.js 7.0.0 and above, now based on [cucumber-messages](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/messages) (instead of the now deceased event protocol).
* All the codebase has been migrated to TypeScript, yey!
* The pretty formatter can now be customised! Ansi styles can be applied to almost all elements of the output.
